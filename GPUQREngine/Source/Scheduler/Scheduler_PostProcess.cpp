//
// This file contains logic to run through the factorization state machine.
// At each stage, different operations are performed:
//
//   - ALLOCATE_WAIT
//     If a front is in ALLOCATE_WAIT then we are waiting for the memory to be
//     available on the gpu. This is a holding state and the front has no work
//     to do at this stage. A front is advanced out of this state by a child
//     front's PARENT_WAIT postprocessor code.
//
//   - ASSEMBLE_S
//     Fronts in ASSEMBLE_S build S Assembly tasks with a granularity specified
//     by the number of data movements we can tolerate on the GPU (for now this
//     value is hardcoded to 4). A front remains in ASSEMBLE_S during
//     postprocessing only if the FillWorkQueue code was unable to add all of
//     the relevant tasks to the GPU work list.
//
//   - CHILD_WAIT
//     The postprocessor checks the number of pending children. When all the
//     children have pushed their data into the current front,
//     the postprocessor advances the front into the FACTORIZE state.
//
//   - FACTORIZE
//     Fronts in FACTORIZE are continuing their factorization as usual.
//     It is very possible that factorization has proceeded to the point where
//     the R factor is ready before the front has finished being factorized.
//     When this happens, the postprocessor kicks off an early async R transfer.
//
//   - FACTORIZE_COMPLETE
//     Fronts in FACTORIZE_COMPLETE initiate an async R transfer. The transfer
//     is idempotent, such that there is only one pending transfer request in
//     flight at any time. This allows for an early R pull in FACTORIZE as well
//     as large R factors to take multiple kernel launches before the transfer
//     completes. The asynchronous transfer uses the cuda events and streams
//     model.
//
//   - PARENT_WAIT
//     A front in PARENT_WAIT attempts to continue transfering the R factor
//     from the GPU to the CPU. Additionally, this code activates the parent
//     front, moving the parent from ALLOCATE_WAIT to its initial state.
//
//   - PUSH_ASSEMBLE
//     Fronts in PUSH_ASSEMBLE build PackAssemble tasks that move data from
//     the child's memory space into the parent's memory space on the GPU.
//     A front only stays in PUSH_ASSEMBLE if the FillWorkQueue code couldn't
//     add all of the required PackAssembly tasks to the GPU queue.
//
//   - CLEANUP
//     Fronts in CLEANUP wait for their corresponding R factors to be
//     transfered off of the GPU.
//
//   - DONE
//     Fronts in DONE have no more work nor additional state transitions.
//     When all fronts are in the DONE state then the QREngine's work is done.
