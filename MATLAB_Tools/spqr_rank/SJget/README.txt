    SJget/SJgrep.m          search for matrices in the SJSU Singular 
                            Matrix Collection.


To install the package, after unzipping the files type
           SJget_install
Remember to save your path so that it includes SJget directory.
Type "pathtool" or "help savepath" in MATLAB for more details.

For an example of use, type this command in MATLAB:

    SJget_example

The MATLAB statement

    Problem = SJget ('HB/ash292')

(for example), will download a singular matrix called HB/ash292 (a least
squares problem) and load it into MATLAB.  You don't need to use your
web browser to load the matrix.  The statement

    Problem = SJget (52)

will also load same the HB/ash292 matrix.  Each matrix in the collection has
a unique identifier, in the range 1 to the number of matrices.  As new
matrices are added, the id's of existing matrices will not change.

To view an index of the entire collection, just type

    SJget

in MATLAB.  To modify your download directory, edit the SJget_defaults.m file.

To open a URL of the entire collection, just type

    SJweb

To open the URL of a group of matrices in the collection:

    SJweb ('HB')

To open the web page for one matrix, use either of these formats:

    SJweb ('HB/ash292')
    SJweb (52)
